## Codewears challenge

I am improving my JavaScript programming skills through challenges on the Codewears platform.
I present my solutions to the so-called Kata tasks. Quest levels are measured in kyu (folder names). The higher the kyu number, the easier the task. Solutions are with tests using Jest. For simplicity, solution and test are in one file.

My actual rank is 5 kyu (8 kyu is the lowest, 1 kyu is the highest)
